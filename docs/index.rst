Zoe - Container-based Analytics as a Service
============================================

Zoe uses Docker Swarm to run Analytics as a Service applications. Currently only Spark is supported, but we are planning inclusion of other frameworks.

It is composed of:

* zoe: command-line client
* zoe-scheduler: the main daemon that performs application scheduling and talks to Swarm
* zoe-web: the web service
