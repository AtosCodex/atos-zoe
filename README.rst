Zoe - Container-based Analytics as a Service
============================================

Zoe provides a simple way to provision data analytics applications using Docker Swarm.

This is the main repository, it contains the documentation and a number of scripts, useful to install and develop Zoe.

We are in the process of updating documentation and scripts. For now you can refer to the version tagged 0.8.92 in this repository,
when all components where still together.

Resources:

-  Main website: http://zoe-analytics.eu
-  Documentation: http://docs.zoe-analytics.eu
-  How to install: http://zoe-analytics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html

Zoe is a distributed application and each component is developed in a separate Git repository.

-  Zoe clients: https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/zoe-client
-  Zoe scheduler: https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/zoe-scheduler
-  Zoe object storage: https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/zoe-object-storage

Zoe can use any Docker image, but we provide some for the preconfigured applications available in the web interface:
