DRAGNN (Dynamic Recurrent Acyclic Graphical Neural Networks) is a framework for building multi-task, dynamically connected computation graphs.
In practice, it uses SyntaxNet as its backend to perform several NLP tasks in a joint model (publicly released models include segmentation + POS tagging + syntactic parsing).

Please note that you need to get the Notebook key from the service logs to be able to access the Notebook.
